## About this tutorial

My fastify/react fullstack bootcamp was the most fun till date. This "tutorial" is 
adapted from the study material I created for that [bootcamp](http://example.com).

There many things here specific to the bootcamp, like ...
1. The only supported OS was Ubuntu/Mint/Debian.
2. Our particular opinionated setup.

## About fastify

Fastify is a web framework for Node.js. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far 
as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town. It is also brilliantly 
designed so it easy to learn and use. It comes with a full compliment of plugins for
all the common use cases like authentication, database access, logging, etc.

In short, Fastify is a great framework for building REST APIs, which is target use case 
of this bootcamp.

## Structure of this tutorial

The tutorial has one goal in mind: to create a REST API for a "book store". It's no
way a complete application, but it is enough to cover all the important aspects of
building a REST API. I will cover enough `fastify` for you to start your final project.

Each section has exercises, which you **should** complete and maintain a git repo for.
We will review your code and score you based on that. We'll discuss the details in
class.
