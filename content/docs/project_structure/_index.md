# Project structure

In the previous section we created a simple web server in one file. That is 
not going to cut it for even the simplest web API, let alone complex real world
applications. In this section we will look at how to structure our project.

## Our approach

Throughout this tutorial we will follow the approach suggested by the `fastify-cli`
utility. This is a very opinionated approach, but it is also very simple and easy
to get started. Towards the end of bootcamp we'll have a series of Sessions / Guest
Lectures where we explore how real companies structure their projects.
