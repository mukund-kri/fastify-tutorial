# Postman for testing API

Up until now, we have been using the browser to test our APIs. But as we start 
building more complex APIs, we will need a more powerful tool to test our APIs.
This is where `postman` comes in. It is a tool dedicated to testing HTTP APIs. It's
arguably the most popular tool for testing HTTP APIs. There are newer tools, but
we're going to stick with `postman` for this course.

## Set up

Download and install the free version from:


https://www.postman.com/


All the download instructions are available on the website.

**BOOTCAMP NOTE**: You are required to use the `postman` tool in the bootcamp. All the 
demos/exercises etc. have been tested using `postman`.

**BOOTCAMP NOTE**: I know that there are dozens of tools that can be used to test
HTTP APIs. But we will use `postman` to standardize the evaluation of demos/exercises 
etc.
